    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Soto ayam is a traditional Indonesian dish with ingredients such as chicken, lontong, noodles, and rice vermicelli. Soto ayam is popular in Singapore, Malaysia and Suriname. Turmeric is added as one of its main ingredients which makes the yellow chicken broth. It is one of the most popular variants of soto, a traditional soup commonly found in Indonesian cuisine. Besides chicken and vermicelli can also be served with hard-boiled eggs, slices of fried potatoes, and Chinese celery leaves. Fried shallots are usually added as a garnish. Coconut milk (santan) is also used as an additional ingredient. Koya, a powder of mixed prawn crackers with fried garlic, or sambal is a common topping. Krupuk or emping is also a common topping. Lalapan is usually served as a side dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp rapeseed (canola) or peanut oil</li>
        <li>2 lemongrass stalks, tough outer leaves removed, lightly crushed</li>
        <li>6 makrut lime leaves</li>
        <li>1.5 litres (6 cups) chicken stock or water</li>
        <li>1 tsp Asian chicken powder (contains MSG and is optional)</li>
        <li>8 large chicken thighs on the bone, skin removed</li>
        <li>100g (3 1/2oz) dried rice vermicelli</li>
        <li>100g (3 1/2oz) shredded green cabbage</li>
        <li>1 small bunch of coriander (cilantro), roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>4 hard-boiled eggs, halved (optional)</li>
        <li>2 spring onions (scallions), thinly sliced into rings</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar (or to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>4 red finger chillies or bird's eye chillies, thinly sliced into rings (optional)</li>
        <li>2 limes, quartered</li>
        <p><b>FOR THE PASTE</b></p>
        <li>8 garlic cloves, smashed 2.5cm (1 inch) piece of ginger,
            roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 macadamia or candle nuts,
            lightly smashed (optional for thickening)</li>
        <li>5 medium shallots (approx.100g/3 1/2oz), roughly chopped
            half tsp ground turmeric</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the paste by placing the ingredients in a blender and blending to a smooth, pourable paste. Set aside. This can be done a day or so ahead of cooking if more convenient.</li>

        <li>When ready to cook, heat the oil over a mediumâ€“high heat in a saucepan that is large enough to hold all the ingredients. Stir in the prepared paste and fry for about 3 minutes to cook out the raw flavour. Then add the crushed lemongrass and the lime leaves.</li>

        <li>Fry for a further minute and then add the chicken stock or water and the Asian chicken powder, if using. Add the chicken to the stock and bring to a simmer.</li>

        <li>Then reduce the heat to medium and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes.    After 45 minutes, lift the lid and remove the chicken with a slotted spoon. Transfer the chicken to a plate to cool some and continue simmering the soup for another 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>While the soup is simmering, you can finish up this dish. Pour boiling water over the rice vermicelli noodles and let them sit in the water until cooked. This should only take a couple of minutes. Strain and divide between 4-6 soup bowls.</li>

        <li>Top each bowl with some chicken, shredded cabbage, coriander (cilantro), a couple of tomato wedges, two halves of egg, if using, and the spring onions (scallions). Taste the stock and add a little sugar if you prefer a sweeter flavour and also add salt to taste.</li>
        
        <li>Add a couple of ladles of the stock to each bowl and serve hot with a side of chopped chillies, if you like, and some lime wedges for squeezing over.</li>
    </ol>
